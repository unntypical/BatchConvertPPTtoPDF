INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Create a folder which you will use to contain all of the PPT & PPTx files you need to convert.
2. Place the files "CONVERT.bat" and "converter.ps1" in this folder. These files should be left in this folder.

3. When you need to convert PPT files into PDF files, drop them into your created folder.
4. Edit the titles of the PPT files to your needs.
5. Double click "CONVERT_.bat" which will run the file, and the powershell script "converter_.ps1".
6. The powershell script will convert all PPT and PPTx files within this folder, and within all subfolders, into PDF files ending in "_cvt".
7. You can find the converted PDF files by searching for "_cvt" in the Windows search box.
8. Move the files out of the convert folder when you are done with them

P.S.
I usually upload the PDF files into OneNote, and delete them as soon as they are finished uploading. I keep the PPT files in a separate folder.
